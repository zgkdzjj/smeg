Smeg SmartSense induction cooktops feature single boost (2,300W and 2,600W) and double boost (3,000W and 3700W) options. Boost provides an additional surge of power for even more intense heat and is ideal for heating large quantities rapidly (eg water for cooking pasta). The temperature will revert to power level 9 when complete (boost is limited to 8–10 minutes if not stopped beforehand)."
